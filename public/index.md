# Hive Platform Documentation

This is the public documentation for Hive and HiveFabric. It focuses on what developers and operators need to run the system, integrate with the APIs, and understand the core components.

## What you can do today

- Run the Honeycomb control plane locally or in Docker
- Register combs (nodes) and send heartbeats via the Stinger SDK
- Visualize combs and tasks in Beekeeper
- Inspect the REST API for comb and task telemetry

## Start here

- Getting started: `public/getting-started.md`
- Architecture overview: `public/architecture.md`
- Components catalog: `public/components/honeycomb.md`
- API reference: `public/apis.md`

## Repositories

- `hive` (Rust core): Honeycomb, Stinger, Wax
- `ui-beekeeper`: Control-plane UI
- `ui-honeybee`: UI shell (future runtime host)

If you need deeper internal notes, roadmap details, or AI collaboration docs, those live in the private documentation.
