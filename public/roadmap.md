# Roadmap (Public)

This roadmap reflects the current post-MVP hardening track.

## Next Milestone

- Stabilize deterministic task execution for UAT:
- queue/schedule/run/completion reliability
- richer task logs (context/input/output) and timing
- scheduler placement visibility
- Harden node lease cleanup and stale task expiry.
- Finalize Apiary prototype catalog behavior and publish flow.
- Complete Honeycomb app wiring for role-routed messaging and embedded-node operations.

## After That

- Persistent task/node storage and retention policies.
- More complete workflow orchestration (fork/join + retries + policy controls).
- Signature verification and stronger trust policies for packaged agents.
- Mobile-first Honeycomb packaging and operational documentation.

## Longer Horizon

- Marketplace maturity (version resolution, trust metadata, optional economics).
- Cross-hive federation and broader policy enforcement.
- Deeper autonomy loop with measurable optimization outcomes.
