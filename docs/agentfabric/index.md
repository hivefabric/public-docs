# AgentFabric Runtime

AgentFabric is the execution engine for Hive tasks. It interprets fork-join directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and orchestrates parallel and sequential execution.

## Key Features

- **Fork-Join DAGs**: Define complex workflows with parallel branches
- **YAML/JSON Support**: Define tasks in human-readable formats
- **SDK/API Integration**: Programmatic task composition
- **Event-Driven**: Stream execution events for monitoring and debugging
- **Multi-Language**: Execute tasks across different runtime environments

## Documentation

- **[Specification](spec.md)** - DAG format, runtime semantics, and execution model
- **[SDK/API](sdk.md)** - Programmatic interfaces and libraries
- **[Examples](examples.md)** - Sample tasks and real-world DAG patterns

## Getting Started

1. Read the [Specification](spec.md) to understand DAG structure
2. Review [Examples](examples.md) for common patterns
3. Use the [SDK](sdk.md) to build your first task
