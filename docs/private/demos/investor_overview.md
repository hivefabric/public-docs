# Investor Overview (Current)

## What HiveFabric is

A distributed control plane and runtime for autonomous agents, designed to run on user-owned devices with a local-first strategy.

## Why it matters

- **Cost**: Use idle compute across user devices.
- **Privacy**: Keep workloads local by default.
- **Portability**: WASM execution across heterogeneous hardware.

## What exists today

- Control plane (Honeycomb) running via Docker
- SDK client (Stinger) reporting real node telemetry
- Beekeeper UI showing live node status

## Next milestone

- Task assignment + scheduling shown end-to-end
- WASM execution integrated in Runtime Wax
