# Demos

This folder contains demo-ready documentation for the **current** state of HiveFabric. Use it to spin up the project quickly, show live progress, and communicate what is working today.

## Contents

- `quickstart_current.md` — Fastest path to a working demo for the current version.
- `demo_script.md` — A step-by-step script for live walkthroughs.
- `investor_overview.md` — One-page narrative focused on value and traction.

## Current status

See `../CURRENT_STATUS.md` for the single source of truth on what works today and supported features.

## Update rule

These files should always reflect the **current** build. If a demo breaks, update the quickstart and status first.
