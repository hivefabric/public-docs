# AI Personas

This directory contains the master prompts that define the core "personas" for the AI agents responsible for building HiveFabric. Each file outlines a specific role, set of skills, and primary directives.

When interacting with an LLM for a specific task, the content of the relevant persona file should be used as the initial system prompt to ensure the AI operates within its designated role and aligns with the project's architecture and goals.
