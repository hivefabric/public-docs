# LLM Development Directory

This directory contains prompts, configurations, and context definitions for the specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) used to build and maintain the HiveFabric project.

The core principle of this project is **LLM-Driven Development**. The canonical project definition, `README.md`, serves as a master prompt and source of truth. The LLM personas defined in the `workers/` subdirectory act as specialized agents, each responsible for a different aspect of the project.
