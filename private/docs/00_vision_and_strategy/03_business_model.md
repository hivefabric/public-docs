# Business Model

HiveFabric follows a freemium and open-core business model designed to encourage widespread adoption while creating sustainable revenue streams.

## 1. User Tiers

*   ### Free Tier
    *   **Offering:** Allows users to run local agents on their own devices using local LLMs. This provides immediate, personal value at a near-zero marginal cost.
    *   **Goal:** Drive adoption and demonstrate the power of the HiveFabric ecosystem without a financial barrier.

*   ### Pro Tier (Subscription)
    *   **Offering:** For users who need more power and convenience. This tier includes features like priority scheduling, credits for cloud-based LLM routing, and access to premium agents in the marketplace.
    *   **Goal:** Provide a clear upgrade path for power users and generate recurring revenue.

## 2. Enterprise Tier

*   **Offering:** A commercial license for companies that want to deploy HiveFabric internally. This includes a self-hosted control plane, private agent registries, advanced security and compliance features, and dedicated support.
    *   **Goal:** Capture value from corporate use cases like internal copilots, autonomous operations, and compliance-aware automation.

## 3. Revenue Sources

The primary revenue streams for the HiveFabric project are:

1.  **Pro Tier Subscriptions:** Recurring monthly or annual fees from individual users.
2.  **Marketplace Commissions:** A percentage of sales from paid agents sold in the Agent Marketplace.
3.  **Enterprise Contracts:** Annual license fees and support contracts from corporate customers.
