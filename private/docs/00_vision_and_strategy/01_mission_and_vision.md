# Mission and Vision

## Vision

To build the default open platform for autonomous AI agents, enabling anyone to run useful AI automation at scale using their own devices. 

Our long-term goal is a world where everyone has access to a team of unlimited AI workers running on their own hardware, with network effects driven by shared compute and a growing agent ecosystem.

## Mission

Our mission is to create **HiveFabric**: a distributed, local-first platform for running and scheduling autonomous AI agents across a global pool of user-owned devices (phones, laptops, desktops, servers), with optional cloud coordination.

We will achieve this by building an "operating system for distributed, evolving autonomous agents" that is secure, portable, and economically accessible to everyone.

**The One-Liner:**

> HiveFabric is *Kubernetes + BOINC + Ollama — for autonomous AI agents.*
