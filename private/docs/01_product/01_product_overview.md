# Product Overview

## 1. What is HiveFabric?

**HiveFabric** is a distributed, local-first platform for running and scheduling autonomous AI agents. It turns a user's collection of devices—phones, laptops, and desktops—into a personal AI cloud.

This allows anyone to run AI agents continuously and cost-effectively by leveraging the idle compute power they already own.

## 2. The Problem We Are Solving

HiveFabric addresses several key problems with the current state of AI:

*   **Cloud AI is Expensive & Centralized:** Running powerful AI today means paying high fees to a few large companies, leading to vendor lock-in and a lack of user control.
*   **Local LLMs are Underutilized:** Many modern devices have powerful chips capable of running local language models, but this compute power sits idle most of the time.
*   **Agent Frameworks are Not Platforms:** Existing AI agent libraries are for developers and lack the runtime, scheduler, and operational tools needed for real-world deployment and management.
*   **There is no "Scheduler for AI Agents":** No system exists to intelligently manage and schedule AI workloads across a distributed, heterogeneous network of personal devices, taking into account factors like cost, privacy, and battery life.

HiveFabric aims to solve these problems by providing the missing infrastructure layer for a decentralized, user-owned AI ecosystem.
