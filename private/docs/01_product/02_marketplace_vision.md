# Marketplace Vision

The HiveFabric Agent Marketplace is a core component of the ecosystem, designed to be the **"GitHub + App Store for AI agents."**

## 1. Core Function

The Marketplace is more than just a store; it serves as a collective **"memory of what worked."** It provides a central location for users and developers to discover, share, and manage AI agents.

Key features include:

*   **Discoverability:** A searchable, categorized index of available agents.
*   **Reputation and Reviews:** Agents are rated and reviewed by users, building a trust-based ecosystem.
*   **Versioning and Signing:** All agents are versioned and must be cryptographically signed by their author, ensuring authenticity and traceability.
*   **Detailed Metadata:** Each agent listing includes its manifest, detailing its purpose, resource requirements, and the security permissions it needs.

## 2. For Users

For users, the Marketplace is the primary way to find new capabilities for their Hive. They can browse for agents that solve specific problems—from personal productivity to home automation—and install them with a single click. The trust system of reviews and signatures allows them to make informed decisions about the software they run.

## 3. For Developers

For developers, the Marketplace provides a distribution channel and a monetization path. By publishing an agent, developers can reach the entire HiveFabric user base. The platform supports both free and paid agents, with a revenue-sharing model that creates a direct financial incentive to build high-quality, useful agents. This flywheel effect is critical for growing the ecosystem.
